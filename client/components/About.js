            I recieved my name at Ellis Island.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 1860, an immigrant stepped foot onto a new continent.
            He could barely speak the language.
            He had left everything he knew behind.
          </p>

          <p>
            The man who processed the immigrant could see his trepidation
            and reminded him that this was a land of opportunity-
            that America is what you make it.
          </p>

          <p>
            There was no need to fear the foreign customs here,
            because the culture was his culture.
            There was no need to fear the language here,
            because the language was his language.
            There was no need to feel like a stranger here,
            because this land was his land.
          </p>

          <p>
            The immigrant took that man's name, Dudley,
            in reverence of the words of kindness and the
            encouragement of a stranger in that uncertain time.
          </p>

          <p>
            The name has spanned six generations of Friedmans.
